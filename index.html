<p style="font-size:20px">Over the duration of this 2nd quarter, I’ve learned many ways to code in ICT. With the new addition of CSS, my coding skills have improved and made my website look even better. Although, I had a hard time learning CSS because of it’s complexity. But, in the end, I was able to help myself with tutorials and taught myself how to properly code. The different ways to style with CSS made my codes look more complicated and hard to understand. However, I got the hang of it and I was able to use it to my advantage. This 2nd quarter, I learned not just how to code, but how to make a proper website. I hope that there will be more lessons like this to give me more creativity. And thanks to ICT, I may be able to use these coding techniques in the future whenever I need them. I hope for the next quarter, I improve on coding better than before.</p>
